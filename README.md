# One More Day
This Azure hosted WebApp helps track progress for exercise.

Following the principal of "Don't Break the Chain" and borrowing on the incremental growth seen in Strong Lifts 5x5 this app will help track progress over a set period of time doing the following 5 exercises.

1. Pushup
2. Situp
3. Squat
4. Plank
5. Wall Squat

## Future Roadmap (WIP)

Initially a single user unauthenticated web-app, it will eventually change into something with the following features;

1. Login for multiple users
2. Competitions between multiple users
3. Instructions how to do each of the 5 exercises correctly with alternates to accomodate different strengths.

## Rules
The rules of the activity will be the following, whether solo or in a competitin.

1. Starting from 1 of each exercise, you increment all exercises when you complete the number of exercises.
2. If you do not complete one or more of the exercises you do not increment the exercises until you manage to do all 5 exercises the required amount.
3. If you miss a day you have a 2 exercise penalty per day.
